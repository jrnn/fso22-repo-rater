## Full Stack Open 2022 | Part 10

Submissions for this part are in a separate repository because, apparently, Expo
acts finicky in a monorepo setting...? Not sure, didn't try my luck.

Submissions for other parts can be found [here](https://github.com/jrnn/full-stack-open-2022).

Note that I occasionally deviated from instructions in the material:
- I used TypeScript because I'm a believer (hallelujah).
- In exercises 10.8, 10.9, 10.21, and 10.22 I didn't use `Formik`. Instead, I
  took the opportunity to explore [react-hook-form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form).
