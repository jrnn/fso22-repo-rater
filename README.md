## Full Stack Open 2022 | Part 10

Submissions for this part are in a separate repository because, apparently, Expo
acts finicky in a monorepo setting...? Not sure, didn't try my luck.

Submissions for other parts can be found [here](https://github.com/jrnn/full-stack-open-2022).

Note that I occasionally deviated from instructions in the material:
- In exercises 10.8 and 10.9, I didn't use `Formik` and `Yup`. Instead, I took
  the opportunity to explore [react-hook-form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form).
